#
# A routing table that associates subnets with {Comm} objects.  Comm
# classes are used to instantiate objects that are tied to remote
# network entities.  For example, {Comm::Local} is used to build network
# connections directly from the local machine whereas, for instance, a
# SOCKS Comm would build a local socket pair that is associated with a
# connection established by a remote SOCKS server.  This can be seen as
# a uniform way of communicating with hosts through arbitrary channels.
